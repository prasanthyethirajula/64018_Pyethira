The decision variables are:

For the quantities produced at Plant 1:

L1: L1 is the no.of units of the Large size product

M1: M1 is the no.of units of the Medium size product

S1: S1 is the no.of units of the Small size product

For the quantities produced at Plant 2:

L2: L2 is the no.of units of the Large size product

M2: M2 is the no.of units of the Medium size product

S2: S2 is the no.of units of the Small size product

For the quantities produced at Plant 3:

L3: L3 is the no.of units of the Large size product

M3: M3 is the no.of units of the Medium size product

S3: S3 is the no.of units of the Small size product

**Formulation of LP problem**
$$ \text{Objective function is Zmax} = 420(L_1+L_2+L_3)+360(M_1+M_2+M_3)+300(S_1+S_2+S_3)$$
$$ \text{Expanding the objective function Zmax}= 420L_1 + 360M_1 + 300S_1 + 420L_2 + 360M_2 + 300S_2 + 420L_3 + 360M_3 + 300S_3 $$
subject to
$$L_1+M_1+S_1\le750$$
$$L_2+M_2+S_2\le900$$
$$L_3+M_3+S_3\le450 $$
$$20L_1+15M_1+12S_1\le13000$$
$$20L_2+15M_2+12S_2\le12000$$
$$20L_3+15M_3+12S_3\le5000$$
$$L_1+L_2+L_3\le900$$
$$M_1+M_2+M_3\le1200$$
$$S_1+S_2+S_3\le750$$
The non-negativity constraints
$$L_1, L_2, L_3, M_1, M_2, M_3, S_1, S_2, S_3\ge0 $$
**The above LP problem constraints can now be written as**
$$L_1+M_1+S_1+0L_2+0M_2+0S_2+0L_3+0M_3+0S_3\le750$$
$$0L_1+0M_1+0S_1+L_2+M_2+S_2+0L_3+0M_3+0S_3\le900$$
